	<h1>Eldas</h1>

	<h2>Month of Abstinence</h2>

	<p>Eldas was named after the creator god Eldan</p>

	<p>This month is in all cultures a month of peace and comtemplation. People
	recollect on the things the live gave them and commemorate to the people who has
	less luck then they. Its not unusal to abstain from a beloved or inured thing to
	remember its worth during the time of Eldas.</p>

	<p>Halflings celebrated in the last week of Eldas the "Burrow Day". It bears in
	remembrance the deprivations of the resistance at the time of the fall of Firnismill
	(-1777).</p>

	<p>Especially in the countryside many Halflings do still celebrate these days in a
	quite traditional way. For the whole week they withdraw into the woods and spend the
	nights in self-made burrows or hollows. In this week they only feed upon the fruits
	of the forest. No fire is allowed to be lit.</p>

	<p>At the end of the week they return in a procession into their villages. Thereby a
	great clamor and noise is performed and the participants of the procession are
	armed, thus symbolizing the recapture of the areas sized by the Orcs. Nowadays in
	the towns and with Halflings of the upper class it has become common practice to
	stay this week in tents erected in the garden or the inner courtyard of their
	houses. There sometimes even meat dishes are served but they are decorated in the
	form of fruits and mushrooms.</p>
