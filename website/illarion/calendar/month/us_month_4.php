	<h1>Ushos</h1>

	<h2>Month of Sowing</h2>

	<p>Named after the creator goddess "Ushara". The Ushos is the last month of
	spring.</p>

	<p>In Gynk they celebrate the "Crocodile Feast" from the 3rd to 17th Ushos. This is
	a huge, lasting street festival in which the people wear animal masks and consume
	large amounts of alcoholic drinks</p>

	<p>Not too seldomly, this leads to the fact that the Gynkese town guards have to
	fish drunken or even drowned people out of the canals. There is even a rumour that
	the Crocodile Feast was named so because in fact it would be a feast for the
	crocodiles, but in truth the canals of Gynk are usually crocodile free.</p>
